Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.
